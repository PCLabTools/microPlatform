This directory is intended for pre and post build scripts to be ran by the PlatformIO core.

If there is a requirement to dynamically change a definition pre build or a post action needs to be taken after building this can be done using Python scripts included in this folder.

In order to enable these scripts please modify the platformio.ini file
